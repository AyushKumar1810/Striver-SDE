# Problem Statement: You're given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
# The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
# The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.

# Pre-requisite: Lower Bound & Binary Search

# Example 1:
# Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 5
# Result: 4 7
# Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

# Example 2: 
# Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 8
# Result: 8 8
# Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.
